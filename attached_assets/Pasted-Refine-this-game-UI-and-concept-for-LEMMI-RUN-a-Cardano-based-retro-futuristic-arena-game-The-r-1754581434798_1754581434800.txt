Refine this game UI and concept for "LEMMI RUN" ‚Äî a Cardano-based retro-futuristic arena game. The result should **not look like it was AI-generated**, but instead feel **handcrafted**, as if developed in Unity by a small passionate indie team in 2003‚Äì2006 who are inspired by classic arcade games and cyberpunk aesthetics. Retain a mix of *pixel-perfect retro UI*, *vibrant neon colors*, and *low-poly 3D models* if applicable.

‚ùáÔ∏è VISUAL GOALS:
- Maintain the retro sci-fi vibe (e.g., neon HUDs, early 2000s UI shapes, old-school font styles)
- Avoid generic AI style artifacts or overly polished assets
- Use visual glitches, CRT-style scanlines, and imperfect edges subtly for realism
- Ensure the NFT/Wallet elements blend *diegetically* into the game lore (not like a DeFi dashboard)
- Make the interface feel like it was part of a console terminal in a rogue AI's arena

üéÆ FUNCTIONAL GOALS:
- "SCAN WALLET" should feel like a mini-game or console command, not a button
- "NFT VERIFICATION" and "ACCESS LEVEL" should change based on real-time input (simulate)
- Add ambient audio cues (e.g., digital humming, static) and retro SFX to interaction
- Currency ($LEMMI Tokens) should feel like in-game arcade tokens, not crypto
- Levels and points should have progression feedback (e.g., XP bar, retro animations)
- Every system should act like part of the *Neural Interface v2.1*, not isolated menus

üì¶ UI/UX COMPONENTS TO REFINE:
- Player Access
- Neural Status
- Inventory
- Skill Tree
- Token Display
- Chaos Mode / Collection (if any)
- Main Hub & Start Game (should be gamified more)

üé® STYLE REFERENCES (Visual direction):
- *Tron: Legacy* meets *Metal Slug UI*
- Old arcade machines with card reader ports
- Unity 5 retro sci-fi templates
- Hacker terminals from *The Matrix*
- SNES/Sega Saturn game menus

üí° GOAL:
Make this feel like a playable, addictive retro-futuristic Unity game where the blockchain elements are fully **immersed into the game's universe** (not bolted-on). All NFTs, tokens, and wallet elements should serve the gameplay, not the other way around.

Generate assets, descriptions, improvements, and UI/UX interactions that reflect the above.
